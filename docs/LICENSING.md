# Won Protocol Licensing Guide

Won Protocol uses a single license across the stack: Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1).

**Key terms:**
- Non-production use, testing, auditing, and development are allowed.
- Production deployments require a license agreement with Temple Earth (licensing@templeearth.cc).
- Change License: GPL-2.0-or-later effective January 1, 2029.
- Additional Use Grant: None (all production deployments require approval).

**Friendly fork program (high-level):**
1. Application process to qualify as a stewarded fork.
2. Independent security audits required for modifications to core contracts.
3. Token alignment: ~1% to the licensor and ~4% to original protocol users (WON/BOLD users).
4. Exclusivity: licensed forks receive chain/collateral exclusivity.
5. Independence post-launch; teams manage their own comms and rewards.
